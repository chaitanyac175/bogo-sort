The time complexity analysis of bogosort is interesting due to its highly inefficient nature. Let's break down the time complexity of bogosort:

Average Case:
Bogosort works by randomly shuffling the elements of the input array and checking if the resulting permutation is sorted. Since there are n! possible permutations of n elements, the probability of randomly selecting a sorted permutation is 1/n!.
Therefore, on average, bogosort will need to perform O(n! * n) random shuffles to find a sorted permutation.
The time complexity of each shuffle operation is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.
Combining these factors, the average time complexity of bogosort is approximately O(n! * n^2).
Worst Case:
The worst-case scenario for bogosort occurs when it takes an indefinite amount of time to randomly generate a sorted permutation of the array.
Since there is no upper bound on the number of shuffles required to find a sorted permutation, the worst-case time complexity of bogosort is technically unbounded.
However, in practical terms, the worst-case time complexity of bogosort is often considered to be O(âˆž) or undefined, as there is no guarantee of termination within any finite time frame.
Best Case:
The best-case scenario for bogosort occurs when the input array is already sorted. In this case, bogosort will require no shuffling and will terminate immediately after the initial check for sortedness.
Therefore, the best-case time complexity of bogosort is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.
